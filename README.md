#####A Better Weather Page for Corsica Digital Sign Servers 

[Corsica](https://github.com/mozilla/corsica-cli) digital sign servers have frequently used the forecast.io weather widget in full screen mode to display local weather information.  

![Sample Images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RAMilewski/CorsicaWx/master/graphics/images/CorsicaWxSample.png)

CorsicaWx used the same Dark Sky API as the forecast.io widget, but is fully configurable.  For example:

  * The default background image is configurable.
  * Background images can be selected by location and/or by weather condition (rain, snow, etc).
  * Random selection of multiple background images for a given location or weather condition is possible.
